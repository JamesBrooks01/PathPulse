# Path Pulse

## Author: James Brooks

## Description

Path Pulse is designed to be a simple and easy to use website that allows a user to view a basic overview of a trip they are planning by providing a city name with start and end dates. The website currently provides weather data with the framework to add more information in the future like local restaurants and other activities.

The website will return information regardless of being logged in or not. However, by logging in the user's trips will be saved and will be returned as a list they can access on subsequent logins, until the user decides they no longer wish to view that trip and can remove it at will.

### The project is primarily a remake and expansion upon a project I previously worked on with a group during my education called Trip Bool, the link to the GitHub Repo for the organization can be found here: [Link](https://github.com/Trip-Bool)
